Storing your LUKS key in TPM NVRAM

First read BUILD, to make sure you have all the runtime pre-reqs installed,
including the upstream trousers and tpm-tools packages.

A. Required steps
B. If the LUKS volume is not your rootfs
C. If the LUKS volume is your rootfs
  I. RHEL6
  II. Fedora 17
D. Sealing your NVRAM area to PCR state

=== A. Required steps ===

	1. You can check that your TPM is available by looking for /dev/tpm0, which
	will exist if a kernel driver is loaded. If not you'll need to load the
	tpm_tis module (or other TPM 1.2 module depending on your platform).

	2. Install tpm-luks, tpm-tools >= 1.3.8, trousers >= 0.3.9. Available at
	   sf.net/projects/trousers. Start the tcsd:
	 # tcsd

	 You can test if trousers and tpm-tools are working ok by running tpm_nvinfo.
	If it errors out with missing library errors, follow these steps:

	 During the trousers build:
	 $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
	or
	 After the trousers build:
	 $ echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
	 # ldconfig

	3. Take ownership of your TPM:
	 $ tpm_takeownership


== B. If the LUKS volume is not your rootfs ==

	1. Determine your LUKS encrypted partions:
	 $ blkid -t TYPE=crypto_LUKS
	 /dev/sda2: UUID="4cb97e1f-b921-4f1a-bd86-032831b277af" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"

	2. Add a new LUKS key to a key slot and the TPM:
	  # tpm_luks -c -d /dev/sda2
	  Enter a new TPM NV area password: 
	  Re-enter the new TPM NV area password: 
	  Enter your TPM owner password: 
	  Successfully wrote 33 bytes at offset 0 to NVRAM index 0x2 (2).
	  You will now be prompted to enter any valid LUKS passphrase in order to store
	  the new TPM NVRAM secret in LUKS key slot 1:

	  Enter any passphrase: 
	  Using NV index 2 for device /dev/sda2

	3. Backup your current LUKS header
	  $ cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup <device> --header-backup-file <file>

	4. Remove the LUKS key slot with the software key
	  $ tpm-luks -k -s <slot>

	tpm-luks creates a 32-byte binary key using data read from /dev/urandom and
	writes it TPM NVRAM. An extra byte is prepended as a version check.

C. If the LUKS volume is your rootfs

  These setup steps for RHEL and Fedora are required to include your current kernel
  and initramfs in the trust chain (if configured in D.) and to insert the code into
  your initramfs to read the LUKS secret from the TPM.

  I. RHEL 6 (may work elsewhere but so far only tested on RHEL 6)

	Run tpm-luks-init, which will attempt to do the following:

	1. Determine your LUKS encrypted partions:
	 $ blkid -t TYPE=crypto_LUKS
	 /dev/sda2: UUID="4cb97e1f-b921-4f1a-bd86-032831b277af" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"

	2. Add a new LUKS key to a key slot and the TPM:
	  # tpm_luks -c -d /dev/sda2
	  Enter a new TPM NV area password: 
	  Re-enter the new TPM NV area password: 
	  Enter your TPM owner password: 
	  Successfully wrote 33 bytes at offset 0 to NVRAM index 0x2 (2).
	  You will now be prompted to enter any valid LUKS passphrase in order to store
	  the new TPM NVRAM secret in LUKS key slot 1:

	  Enter any passphrase: 
	  Using NV index 2 for device /dev/sda2

	3. Add code to query the TPM to the initramfs:
	# dracut /boot/initramfs-2.6.32-XXX.el6.x86_64-tpm-luks.img

	4. Create a new boot entry that uses the new initramfs:
	# vi /boot/grub/menu.lst

	(The only change you need to make here is to copy the current boot entry
	for the RHEL kernel and change the initramfs path to
	/boot/initramfs-2.6.32-XXX.el6.x86_64-tpm-luks.img)

  II. Fedora 17

	Run tpm-luks-init, which will attempt to do the following (note
	that tpm-luks-init uses grubby, which seems to have problems with
	grub2, YMMV):

	1. Determine your LUKS encrypted partions:
	 $ blkid -t TYPE=crypto_LUKS
	 /dev/sda2: UUID="4cb97e1f-b921-4f1a-bd86-032831b277af" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"

	2. Add a new LUKS key to a key slot and the TPM:
	  # tpm_luks -c -d /dev/sda2
	  Enter a new TPM NV area password: 
	  Re-enter the new TPM NV area password: 
	  Enter your TPM owner password: 
	  Successfully wrote 33 bytes at offset 0 to NVRAM index 0x2 (2).
	  You will now be prompted to enter any valid LUKS passphrase in order to store
	  the new TPM NVRAM secret in LUKS key slot 1:

	  Enter any passphrase: 
	  Using NV index 2 for device /dev/sda2

	3. Add code to query the TPM to the initramfs:
	# dracut /boot/initramfs-3.4.4-5.fc17.x86_64-tpm-luks.img

	4. Create a new boot entry that uses the new initramfs:
	# vim /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

	(The only change you need to make here is to copy the current boot entry
	for Fedora and change the initramfs path to 
	/boot/initramfs-3.X.X-X.fc17.x86_64-tpm-luks.img)

	From https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GRUB_2:
	"It is safe to directly edit /boot/grub2/grub.cfg in Fedora."

	8. Reboot

D. Sealing your NVRAM area to PCR state

	"Sealing" means binding the TPM NVRAM data to the state of your machine. Using
	sealing, you can require any arbitrary software to have run and recorded its
	state in the TPM before your LUKS secret would be released from the TPM chip.
	The usual use case would be to boot using a TPM-aware bootloader which records
	the kernel and initramfs you've booted. This would prevent your LUKS secret
	from being retrieved from the TPM chip if the machine was booted from any other
	media.

	To get a full chain of trust up through your initramfs, you'll first need to
	install TrustedGrUB, available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/trustedgrub/.
	A vanilla install of TrustedGrUB doesn't appear to work with Fedora 17 -- if
	you get TrustedGrUB working with recent fedora distros, please send a note
	to trousers-users@lists.sf.net or key@linux.vnet.ibm.com.

	Note that trustedgrub is supported 32bit only, so you'll need for example
	the glibc-devel.i686 and libgcc.i686 packages to build it on x86_64.

	Once you've installed TrustedGrub successfully, reboot, then continue
	with these steps:

	1. Edit /etc/tpm-luks.conf
	 ATM, only the "srtm" profile or PCRs 0-15 are supported.

	2. Complete the steps in C.I. or C.II. above

	3. At yum update time:
	  tpm-luks installs a yum post-transaction hook in
	  /etc/yum/post-actions/tpm-luks.action. Whenever the kernel package is
	  updated, the hook runs the tpm-luks-update script, which attempts to
	  migrate your current TPM NVRAM secret to the new PCR values for the
	  changed kernel+initramfs.
